# game-coding
A collection of projects I created for game development. Everthing is written in C#, which I like a lot.

## JSONator
Very basic, but fully featured JSON parser. Supports all JSON features according to json.org specification.

## OkuEngine
This is my try at a simple 2D game engine. It has some nice features like a plugin architecture for Graphics and Sound engines. Default is OpenGL and OpenAL.

## OkuMath
A try to create a fully featured 2D game math library. In a very early stage at the moment.

## Rouge/RougLike
An unfinished and disconinued project to created some 2D rouge like. The code has interessting stuff. That's why I keep it.

## SimGame
Another unfinished game prototype inspired by the ludum dare entry Basement (http://ludumdare.com/compo/2014/04/29/basement/).

## ThinGL
An unfinished try at creating my own OpenGL wrapper for C#. I was frustrated with the wrappers at that time as they all were way behind the recent OpenGL versions.

## InitGLWindow
Project to create a simple template for creating and initializing a simple window and initializing OpenGL the correct, modern way. Uses OpenGL.NET (https://github.com/luca-piccioni/OpenGL.Net).
