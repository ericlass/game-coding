- Situation: Menus should also be done with entities and behaviors
  -> A menu does not have a player or map entity
  -> The behavior components for menus do not need any "damagePlayer" or "addInventory" functions. These are only needed by some behaviors like enemies and chests.
  -> But an enemy behavior must know the player entity somehow
